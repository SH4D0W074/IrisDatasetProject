# Iris Dataset Classification (Machine Learning)

This project is a beginner machine learning classification task using the classic **Iris Flower Dataset**.  
The goal is to predict the species of an iris flower based on measurements such as petal length and sepal width.

## 🚀 Project Overview

I explored the dataset visually, then trained a **Logistic Regression** model to classify iris species.

This project helped me build practical understanding of:

- Supervised learning workflows  
- Data exploration and feature analysis  
- Model evaluation using cross-validation

## 📊 Key Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using visualisations
- Logistic Regression model implementation
- 5-fold cross validation for improved reliability
- Achieved **96% accuracy** on classification

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn**

---

## 📈 Results

- Initial rule-based classifier achieved ~89% accuracy  
- Logistic Regression with cross-validation improved performance to **96% accuracy**
